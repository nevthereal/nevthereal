## What I am doing now

I am a student at the MNG Rämibühl in Zurich, Switzerland and I am interested in Computer Science, Digital Content Creation and Design.
I am a Web Dev in React. Find out more on my **[website](https://nevillebrem.com)**!

## What I am planning for the future
I want to go fullstack. In the past I've used React as my go to library, but I am currently learning SvelteKit as a full web framework. I definitely want to build some complex apps with SvelteKit, such as a blog, an e-commerce page and more.

## My current stack
- Skeleton UI:
  - SvelteKit
  - Tailwindcss

## Roadmap
- [x] SvelteKit
- [ ] Supabase
- [ ] Drizzle ORM

## Projects
See my **pinned repositories** or on my [website](https://nevillebrem.com) for **demo projects**

## Business

I am open for **projects** or **small contracts**. I have a keen eye on **detail**, **fast response times** and much experience in **frontend design**.
